Rough draft of the project

Solana bridges use a lock-and-mint/burn-and-unlock mechanism:

1. Locking: Assets are locked in a smart contract on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum).

2. Minting: Equivalent wrapped tokens are minted on Solana.

3. Burning: To return assets, wrapped tokens are burned on Solana.

4. Unlocking: Original assets are released on the source chain.
(This ensures a 1:1 asset peg) .
